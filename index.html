        <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <h3> Maroon 5 started published it's first successful album in 2002, though the band was created in 1994. There are eight members in the band, though originally there were five. Hence, the name <em><strong>Maroon 5. </em></strong> 
            When most people think of Maroon 5, they think of <em> Adam Levine </em>, the lead singer. Maroon 5 has participated in many collaborations with artists such as Julia Michaels, Cardi B, SZA, Gwen Stefani, and many more. Maroon 5 has a long history, as it was actually created when four of the band's members were in high school here at Brentwood in California. The band was called "Kara's Flowers", and became "Maroon 5" when James Valentine, the guitarist was added to the list of band members. 
             Over the years some of Maroon 5's members have left or have left and then come back. </h3>
